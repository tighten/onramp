## How to contribute to Onramp

#### **Do you have content you can add?**

* You can add the content directly in `learn.{language}.php`

* You can add an issue referencing the content if it's not clear where it should go in the relevant `learn` document

#### **Do you want to code on the app itself?**

* Open or comment on an issue before starting to code to ensure Matt (or someone else) isn't already working on it and that you fully understand the goals and scope

* Once ready to code, fork the repo, and PR your changes in, referencing the original issue number

#### **Do you have questions about the plans for Onramp?**

* Ask any question about how to contribute to or use Onramp in the issues here

Thanks! :heart:

Matt
