- [ ] Figure out how we handle resources that are links to projects (e.g. vagrant)... not really an "article"
- [ ] Decide: Do we need to be able to group our resources? e.g. all the hosting resources (valet, vagrant, etc.) are related.. all of the "php variables" resources are related... flat structure seems weak
- [ ] Make checkboxes work
- [ ] Refactor module show page to use a view presenter or something like it
- [ ] Evaluate and re-work microcopy (e.g. guest banner on learning pages)
- [ ] Add the idea of the "order" of modules within a track
- [ ] Investigate: where else do we need "order"
- [ ] Deal with the rigamarole of "mustverifyemail" for users
- [ ] Consider/decide: allow for marking a give module as "current"
