## Language translations

To make language translation strings available to the Vue.js frontend, a `translations.js` file is generated from the Laravel language files found in the `resources/lang` directory. To regenerate this `translations.js` file after translations have been changed or added, run:

```bash
php artisan export:messages-flat
```
