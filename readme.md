Onramp aims to be a collection of resources presented in a way that makes it possible for folks to become Laravel programmers as easily and effectively as possible.

## How can I help?

Check out the issues and look at `learn.en.php` or `learn.es.php` to see if there's any *free* content you think we could add.

## What's the plan?

Right now, the plan is to finalize a decent list of "tracks" (new to programming, frontend developer, WordPress developer) and "modules" ("Introductory terminal & git", "Laravel routing", "Introductory object-oriented programming", etc.).

Once those have been finalized, we can start building an actual tool. The first steps will be to build out the tracks and modules in a database. Then, we can allow users to pick a track (or pick "Just Exploring") and then log into a dashboard where they will just see the modules recommended for their track.

They can click into a module and see the possible free online sources for learning about that topic ("resources"), click a checkbox that says "I feel like I know enough about this resource/module to consider it done" (complete the module), and then move to the next module.

They could also, eventually, take small quizzes about that module (self-testing, not for certification or external validation) and try out some code exercises about that module.

I think that might be it? For now. :)
