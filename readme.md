Onramp aims to be a collection of resources presented in a way that makes it possible for folks to become Laravel programmers as easily and effectively as possible.

## How can I help?

Check out the [Dev Page](https://onramp.dev/en/dev) to learn more about how to contribute.

## What's the plan?

We have a tool built with tracks and modules and basic content. We're still finalizing the translation system and the relationships between all the content, then we can build in more user interactivity.

We want to allow users to pick a track (or pick "Just Exploring") and then log into a dashboard where they will just see the modules recommended for their track.

They can click into a module and see the possible free (or paid) online sources for learning about that topic ("resources") and check them off, click a checkbox that says "I feel like I know enough about this resource/module to consider it done" (complete the module), and then move to the next module.

They could also, eventually, take small quizzes about that module (self-testing, not for certification or external validation) and try out some code exercises about that module.

See more plans in the chat and in the issues.
